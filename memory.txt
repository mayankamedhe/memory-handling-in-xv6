1. Explain the code in each of the lines 3177 and 3178.
3177 r->next = kmem.freelist;
3178 kmem.freelist = r;

it is removing the first element from r

2. Consider the following sequence of statements executed in walkpgdir function. Explain what each
line in this code is trying to do and how it achieves it.
1740 pde = &pgdir[PDX(va)];
1742 pgtab = (pte_t*)p2v(PTE_ADDR(*pde));
1753 return &pgtab[PTX(va)];

pde is equal to address of the table entry PDX(va)
pgtab is equal to the virtual address of pde
it is returing the pte table
